                <h3>Who is your local Muslim Hero?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Muslims are amazing human beings doing brilliant & leading edge work, while also being compassionate people.
                    Letâ€™s show everyone that Muslims are making the world a better place, one step at a time.
                  </p>
                <h3><br/><br/>How to get started</h3>
                  <p>We want to showcase the small and big acts Muslims are doing to make their community a better place! Help us recognize and celebrate your local Muslim hero, and let's create a culture of positivity around Muslims trying to make a difference. Do you know a Muslim in your community you want to recognize?</p> 
                  <p>1. Take a picture of the individual</p>
                  <p>2. Write a short blurb on what they are doing</p>
                  <p>3. Share for the world to see</p>
                <h3><br/><br/>How to support these Heroes?</h3>
                  <p>You can show your support by giving duas to these Muslim individuals. Under each nominee there is a dua button which illustrates your support for them. It indicates that you are giving them duas for their actions and their continued success in the future.</p>

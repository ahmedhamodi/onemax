## OneMAX

### Project Goal
At OneMAX, our goal is to create a fully immersive website for individuals to nominate other individuals in their respective communities for ourstanding work they are doing. This website has a goal of promoting social good and involvement in our local communities. We have a "dua" voting system so other users of the website can give duas to these outstanding individuals.

### Technicals
We are using React for our front end, and PostgreSQL for our backend. We are currently hosting the website using a Heroku App. It can be accessed at https://polar-falls-71863.herokuapp.com/ currently, but we hope to move to a custom domain name shortly.
